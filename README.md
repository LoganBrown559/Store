A College Assignment, first coding project for the semester.

//Describes the project, and a bit of the journey making it

This project was... rough. Mostly because I'm in a new language, coding things I have never heard of before, and I have too much work to do along with this project.
I tried a lot of things to kind of grow into C#, and overall I like it. There are a few quirks that make me mad or confuse me, but otherwise it's a lot of fun.
I like the exception handling with try/catch, I used it in a couple spots where it could git "risque" with user inut. I also made a seperate class in main
called ItemManip, thinking about the naming of the iomanip library in C++. It made a lot of the menu logic cleaner and simpler, and was over all fun.

I made all required functions, but ended up remaking them simply so I could have better names and different implimentation. Such thing as getPrice() made
me happy, because it actually has the word "get" in it. This makes the method much clearer off the bat instead of "checkPrice".

Otherwise this progect got more enjoyable as time went on. I still give the Erfahrung a 0/10, I had too much work from this class and other classes.
Especially this class. It's a lot of worked dumped on us as soon as it could be posted. It ended up just making me more stressed than I should be, seeing as I split the coding up into 5 different days to make it easier to fit into my life.
